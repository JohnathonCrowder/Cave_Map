Notes on Cave Maping Application


   First, to anyone who may take the time to check out my project, Thank you for your time. Here in these notes, I will quickly explain the basis of the application.  I was inspired to create this after realizing how difficult it is to access the location of caves. This application tries to help solve that issue by creating an easy-to-use tool to view the cave locations. 
 It provides highly accurate co-ordinates of cave locations across the United States. I chose the United States as it contains many caves and is my native country. God Bless America (insert fireworks and large trucks here)

As you can see above, there are thousands of caves. To help display this the program uses clustering to group nearby caves. If you zoom into an area the clusters will break down into individual cave locations. This tool can be used to filter through these many cave systems. On the right of the application, you can see a list of all the caves. The user also has several options to filter these caves. First, the user can search for the cave by name. Second, ther user can filter the caves by the distance in miles from there current city. The users location is automatically obtained and is a general estimation as opposed to an exact location. With either searching by name or miles, both the map and the list box are updated with each character. This provides for a fluent and active filtering experience. Here is an example search:

The user can also select caves from the list or on the map to view more detail:

The user also has the option to turn the map into satellite mode:
